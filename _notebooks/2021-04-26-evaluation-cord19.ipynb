We call this ‘stratified periodic testing’. It is ‘stratified’ as it is based on at-risk groups, and ‘periodic’ as everyone in the group is tested at regular intervals. We argue that this is a better use of scarce testing resources than ‘universal random testing’, as has been recently discussed globally. We find that, under reasonable assumptions and allowing for false negative results 30 per cent of the time, 17 per cent of a subgroup would need to be tested each day to lower the effective reproduction number R from 2.5 to 0.75, under stratified periodic testing. Using the same assumptions the universal random testing rate would need to be 27 per cent (as opposed to 7 per cent as argued by Romer (2020b)). We obtain this rate of testing using a corrected method for calculating the impact of an infectious person on others, and allowing for asymptomatic cases. We also find that the effect of one day’s delay between testing positive and self-isolating is similar to having a test that is 30 per cent less accurate.',\n",
       "     'body_text-full': 'Governments around the world are looking for a testing strategy for COVID-19; one that will ensure that the escape from lockdown is as fast as possible, given a certain level of safety. This strategy will inevitably be constrained by our testing capacity: every person in the world cannot be tested every day. Given these constraints, we argue that ‘stratified periodic testing’ is an efficient way of using scarce testing resources, and provides a way for calculating the frequency of testing needed to stop the spread of the virus within a particular group. We also argue that our method is more efficient than ‘universal random testing’, which has been widely discussed since it was proposed by Romer (2020b). Our proposal is ‘stratified’ because it focuses testing on groups who are at particular risk of spreading the infection. This may be because they have a high basic reproduction number, R0, to begin with, like healthcare workers. Or, it may be because they have a high reproduction number because of the way lockdown has been unevenly applied, for example delivery drivers remaining active. The choice of groups may also take into account fatality rates if they were to spread the virus (like those in care homes for the elderly), or the economic impact if the group needed to be isolated (as discussed by Kasy and Teytelboym (2020)). Constraints on testing capacity mean that this is a more workable and efficient solution than testing the entire population. We also propose that tests should be ‘periodic’, rather than random. This ensures that each member of the group is certain to be tested at regular intervals, which improves the efficiency of testing. For example, it can prevent some individuals being tested on two successive days, and others having to wait a disproportionate length of time to be re-tested. We show that this increases the efficiency of any given number of tests by approximately 37 per cent, at no extra cost. Using this approach we find that, under plausible assumptions, 17 per cent of a group would need to be tested each day to reduce the virus’s reproduction rate from R0=2.5 to R’=0.75 (see section IV). This allows for half the cases to be symptomatic, and therefore self-isolating after 5 days. It also allows for people to be infectious on the day of their test, and for 30 per cent of tests to return false negative results. If there are no false negatives, or if people are not infectious on the day they test positive (which we think would be difficult to achieve in practice), then the required testing rate would be 12–13 per cent per day. Naturally, even less testing would be required if it were to be accompanied by low-cost interventions (e.g. face masks) that reduce the group’s initial R0. To set our results in context, we also consider ‘universal random testing’. This was proposed by Romer (2020a,b), who argued that randomly testing 7 per cent of the entire population every day would be sufficient to bring the effective reproduction number down to R’=0.75. In this proposal he made the important point that the economic benefit of a speedier recovery would be measured in $trillions and this would easily justify spending $billions on testing; he also argued that it is not necessary for such testing to be highly accurate. Unfortunately, as we show, Romer’s calculations did not allow for asymptomatic cases, or delays in isolation, and also contained an error. Using a corrected model we find that universal random testing would require 27 per cent of the population to be tested each day—an impossible task. So long as testing remains a scarce and relatively expensive resource, we argue that testing of the general population should be reserved for two purposes. Informational tests will help identify the groups that need to be included in stratified periodic testing, though the samples required for this will be very small relative to the size of the whole population. Antibody tests would allow those that have been infected to get back to work, providing that those who have been infected turn out to be immune to future infection. The paper is organized as follows. Section II lays out our objective of reducing the effective reproduction rate down to R’=0.75, and section III describes our strategy for achieving this: stratified periodic testing. Section IV then describes how to calculate the testing rate needed in a particular subgroup to achieve the objective. Section V calculates the testing rates needed to achieve the same objective under universal random testing, under a variety of assumptions. Section VI compares the results of the two methods, while section VII concludes. In Appendix 1 we derive the testing rate required to achieve R’=0.75 under stratified periodic testing, if people are not infectious on the day they test positive. Appendix 2 considers two papers by Romer (Romer, 2020a,b) which argue in favour of universal random testing, and shows why we think that these papers contain an error. Appendix 3 provides a simple formula which can be used to support the conclusions in the body of the paper that universal random testing strategy would not control the spread of the virus, and which also provides some simple intuition as to what would be required for that strategy to work. The reproduction number R in an epidemic is the expected number of cases directly generated by any one infectious case. The basic reproduction number, R0, is the initial value of R.1 We assume that the value of R0 for the whole population is R0 = 2.5 (following Romer, 2020a,b). When R0, > 1, the speed at which the disease spreads depends not only on that value of R0, but also on the rapidity of transmission, and—in particular—on the number of days for which an infected individual remains infectious, and on whether the infectiousness of an individual is particularly great during the early days of his or her infection. It is clear that an epidemic can only be prevented from spreading by a policy which creates an effective reproduction number, R’ (R prime), of less than 1. When that happens, each infected person will infect less than one new person, and the epidemic will die out. If the value of R’ is brought down to a number well below 1 then the epidemic will die out quickly. In our calculations below we explore the effect of a policy designed to produce an effective reproduction number R’ of 0.75. Our means of doing this will be to test some subset of the population each day and then to isolate those who are found to be infected. The effective reproduction number R’ in these circumstances is the product of the basic reproductive number, R0, and the fraction of the infectious population that is not isolated. We have chosen the number 0.75 because this was the number chosen by Romer (2020b). Let φ be the proportion of the infectious population which is isolated. Then we can write Equation (1): To achieve an objective of R’ = 0.75 when R0 = 2.5, Equation (1) implies that that φ = 0.7, i.e. that 70 per cent of the infectious population is isolated, and that sufficient tests and isolation are carried out to make this possible. We argue that testing should be carried out at different frequencies for different stratified groups, based on their likelihood of infecting others. This likelihood can be deduced from their occupation, geography, likely behaviour when not isolated, and other factors.3 Testing at rates above 20 per cent per day could be done for carefully selected groups which have a high basic reproduction number (R0) relative to others. Doing that would enable greater rates of isolation in these groups, lowering their effective reproduction number (R’) and helping to prevent the epidemic spreading where it matters most.4 Identifying high-risk groups and testing them frequently appears to be a much lower-risk strategy for containing the spread of infection than randomly testing the entire population (which we consider in sections V and VI). The strategy being advocated here would be easier to pursue if cheap tests were used, even ones that were somewhat inaccurate.5 Broadly, there are two types of people who are likely to have a particularly high basic reproduction number relative to others. The first are those who have a high basic reproduction number to begin with. These are individuals who would have been more likely to infect others, before the infection had begun to spread and any policy interventions had been adopted. Members of large religious congregations are one example, because of their tendency to meet in large groups indoors. Doctors are another, as they have very frequent and unavoidable close contact with others. Their basic reproduction number will, as a result, be very high and very frequent testing will be necessary to ensure that their effective reproduction number is low enough. As a result, there could be very frequent testing for doctors in hospitals to ensure that the effective reproduction rate for them is brought well below 1. It appears likely that the relevant calculations will show that doctors actually need to be tested every day. But there are also other people who will have a high basic reproduction number because of the uneven application of the lockdown and other factors that might affect variation in infectiousness across groups.6 For many people, for instance, lockdown means that they are confined to their homes (including many workers who are able to work from home), reducing their basic reproduction number to well below 1. But key workers, who are encouraged to keep working in spite of the lockdown, will have a higher basic reproduction number as a result (e.g. those involved in food production and distribution). The same will be true for all those who are unable to work from home and are given permission to avoid the lockdown (e.g. those involved in construction and manufacturing). Another group that is likely to have a higher basic reproduction number is those who are more exposed to people who are particularly susceptible to the infection (e.g. prison warders and care workers). As testing is rolled out it will become increasingly appropriate to test all such people frequently. One challenge in all this is that the basic reproduction number may be high in particular groups for idiosyncratic reasons that are hard to anticipate. The kinds of calculation described in the next section could easily be carried out for structured samples in different locations, in order to identify these pockets of infectiousness. The general principle, then, is that testing should be concentrated in groups that have high reproduction numbers relative to others, in the current state of the world. But this principle should not be interpreted too strictly. In certain cases, other criteria may also be important: for instance, we may want to regularly test groups that interact with those who are more likely to die from the infection (this is another reason to test care workers more frequently) or groups whose absence would have a greater economic impact than others (see Kasy and Teytelboym, 2020). Universal random testing is an alternative regime that has been widely discussed recently (see Romer, 2020b; Long, 2020; Chotiner, 2020). This approach involves, after prioritizing some of the most important groups,7 mass testing for the whole population, in order to get the effective reproduction number down for the whole population. This testing is also random, rather than at pre-specified periods. The approach is summarized in a Twitter thread which concludes as follows: Instead, we argue that testing must be focused on particular groups. This is because our findings, discussed in section V below, show that a mass testing plan would still leave the effective reproduction number significantly above 1 unless it was carried out infeasibly frequently. Nevertheless, there will still need to be random testing of groups in the population, and some random testing of the whole population. But this testing would be for informational purposes only and would only involve testing very small samples of those involved. Such informational testing will be needed for two reasons. First, random testing of small samples from particular groups will be necessary to track groups in which the basic reproduction number is already known to be high, and where there is greater potential for a high rate of spread. Once identified, these groups will then need very frequent testing of everyone in the group, for the reasons which we have been discussing in this paper. But testing of small samples of wider groups in the whole population will also be needed to identify new groups where the basic reproduction number is high. As before, this may be for idiosyncratic reasons that are hard to anticipate. Once identified, such groups will then also need very frequent testing of everyone in the group. But the accuracy of this testing for informational reasons will be determined by the sample size, rather than population size. The samples required for these informational purposes will be very small relative to the size of the whole population. Once the frequency of testing has been decided and testing kits are available, testing can begin for everyone in the identified groups. But it is important that this testing be done periodically for each person, rather than there being a random choice of those who are to be tested in each time period. The rationale underlying periodic testing can be explained by the ‘waiting-time paradox’.9 Random testing, say, of 20 per cent of a group each day, wastes many resources. This is because every day some of those tested will have actually been tested the day before, while others of those who are infectious will, nevertheless, not be tested and so will possibly continue infecting people. By contrast, periodic testing of 20 per cent of a group means that, on days 1 to 5, a different fifth of the group will be tested each day, and that on day 6 the first fifth of the group will tested again, and so on. It is clear that this means each person tested will have been tested exactly 5 days previously, removing the problem that some tests are being wasted and that other tests are being postponed for too long. Because of this, you need to test far fewer individuals in a group to get the same reduction in R. In section VI, we provide a simple account of this issue, and show how important it is likely to be. We show that with high testing rates, periodic testing beats random testing by a very significant factor. In this paper, we have been discussing diagnostic testing (i.e. testing for active infections) as opposed to antibody testing (i.e. testing for those who have had the disease and are both immune and non-infectious). A combination of the two types of testing might be effective and realistic if the diagnostic testing capacity remains constrained, but antibody tests become widely available. One might then proceed as follows. All of this could be done using cheap diagnostic tests, even if they were somewhat inaccurate. It is not the case that ‘no test is better than an unreliable test’. Our calculations show that, while accurate tests are absolutely necessary for clinical reasons when treating an individual person, much more rough-and-ready testing is satisfactory if the purpose of this testing is epidemiological control through isolation. (In our baseline calculations discussed below, for instance, we assume that 30 per cent of infected people wrongly test negative.) Doing all of this will help governments to track the spread and to determine where hotspots are flaring up. Such information will help them to work out how to selectively tighten, or loosen, containment measures when needed. Such a testing procedure would involve doing two things at once: the stratified periodic diagnostic testing which we have been discussing would be designed to dampen the spread of the disease in key groups, by catching those in these groups who were infectious but asymptomatic, or pre-symptomatic, or post-symptomatic, and so not self-isolating. At the same time, antibody testing for the entire population would separate out the immune population. Passing an antibody test would enable such people to return to work. Having described what stratified periodic testing looks like, we now derive more formal results for the testing rate required to get R down to R’ = 0.75, and the testing ‘threshold’ at which R’ = 1. In section V we go on to show that periodic testing is about 37 per cent more effective than random testing, at no extra cost. We assume that the number of days an infected person is infectious is d = 14, following Romer (2020b). Fourteen days is familiar in the analysis of COVID-19 as the period after which the person is either dead or—much more likely—recovered, but no longer infectious.12 For simplicity we also assume that there is uniform contagion throughout the 14-day period. So, if R0 = 2.5, and if there were no testing which led to the isolation of infected people, then an infectious person would infect 2.5 people in total, or 2.5/d persons per day over a period of d days. The results which follow obviously depend both on our assumed value of d and on our assumption that the infectiousness of an individual is not disproportionately great during the early days of his or her infection.13 In almost all countries, an important part of the current policy response to COVID-19 is that those who show symptoms are required to self-isolate. Because of this, only asymptomatic people and those who have chosen not to self-isolate, for example with mild or mistaken symptoms, will be spreading the disease, and will be included in those who are tested. We assume that all of those infected are asymptomatic for 5 days (and are subject to testing during that time). After 5 days a proportion of the population, α, displays symptoms and self-isolates. This means that only a proportion (1 – α) go on infecting others, and being tested, from day 6 onwards. The proportion of asymptomatic patients isn’t really known, and estimates vary wildly. The World Health Organization suggests that as many as 80 per cent of cases are asymptomatic or mild. Very inexact data from Iceland suggest that all infectious patients are asymptomatic for the first 5 days and that, after this time, only about half become symptomatic. We use these Icelandic figures when constructing the ‘base case’ in our calculations, so α = 0.5. Following Romer (2020b) we allow for the tests to return false negatives. We let n be the proportion of false negatives and assume that n=0.3 (i.e. 30 per cent of those who are infected test negative). We let R’ be the expected number of people that a randomly chosen infected person infects before that person is positively tested (or stops being infective, if sooner). Let rj be the expected number of people infected by an individual on day j of his/her infection, for j =1, 2,...,d where the length of infectivity is d. Thus R′=∑dj=1rj   . Now suppose an individual is tested every N days, and that for high-risk groups we test very frequently, so that  N<d. We assume that the time of the infection is random and an infected individual remains infective on the day of the test, and is only isolated from the following day onwards, since this is more likely than instant isolation. (We also consider the case of instant isolation in Appendix 1 and Figure 3.) Then, From this we can deduce that Here we introduce our self-isolation factor α into equation (3) by noting that rj during the infectious and asymptomatic period (first 5 days), which we denote as d0=5, is still r0 =R0/d    and thereafter rα =(1−α)R0/d for the infectious period in which a person may self-isolate. Substituting these values into rj we have three alternative situations to consider: (i) the case when N<d0 for which the testing rate is more frequent than the move to becoming symptomatic that occurs after day d0 and therefore equation (3) represents this outcome entirely; (ii) the case when d0 < N < d for which the testing period N is between 6 and 13 days inclusive, and finally (iii) the case when N ≥ d. The following is for the case when d0 < N < d which is the testing range that tends to deliver an R’ < 1 for this model of testing: We take rα=(1−α)R0/d to be the daily likelihood that an infected individual will infect another person during the period in which they may become symptomatic and self-isolate with probability α. This gives14 We now use equation (5) to solve for the value of N, the number of days between each periodic test that is required to bring R down from R0=2.5 to R’= 0.75. We find that the required periodic testing rate is 17 per cent of the population (or a test every 6 days), when isolation happens the day after a positive test. This assumes a test has a 30 per cent false negative rate. If these tests were perfect, then the required test rate could be 12 per cent of the population per day (or once every 8.2 days). If we instead use instant tests with 30 per cent false negatives (see Appendix 1 and Figure 3), the required testing rate is 13.4 per cent (or every 7.7 days). It is interesting to note that the effect on testing rates is similar for having an unreliable test (30 per cent false negatives versus no false negatives), and having to wait a day for results. In section V we show that these testing rates required to get R’=0.75 are around 37 per cent lower than those required under universal random testing. \\nFigure 1 plots R’ as a function of t, the proportion of the population tested each day. It does this for various values of α, the proportion of infected people who display symptoms and self-isolate from day 6 onwards. Higher levels of α mean that the effective reproduction rate, R’, is lower for a given level of testing; this effect is particularly marked at lower levels of the daily population testing rate. As we have already seen, when α = 0.5 the testing rate t needs to be about 17 per cent to get R’ down to 0.75. Figure 1 also displays the different testing rates needed to obtain a range of different values for R’, for a variety of values of α. This enables us to identify the threshold testing rates, t* that reduce R’ to exactly 1: the value which divides outcomes in which the epidemic dies out from outcomes in which it explodes. For α = 0.5, this threshold testing rate implied to bring R’ to 1 is t* = 11 per cent, i.e. 11 per cent of the population would need to be tested each day. To achieve this, everyone would need to be tested every 9 days. \\nFigure 1 also shows us how sensitive this threshold testing rate is to α, the proportion of those who are infected who self-isolate from day 6 onwards. For testing rates that are below 20 per cent per day (i.e. less frequent than once every 5 days, the period for which a person is assumed to be asymptomatic), we can clearly see how sensitive this threshold testing rate is to α. This is an important figure since α may change from population group to population group. For example, contract workers who are paid by the hour have a direct incentive to ignore symptoms. This would translate to a lower α for this group and consequently a much higher R’ for any rate of testing. Workers in this category who also have high contact rates as part of their job would therefore be expected to require the highest rate of testing. The epidemic would be most easy to control if all infected individuals become symptomatic after 5 days, and then all self-isolated. (This would mean that α = 1.00.) In such a case, as we can see, R’ ≈ 1 even without any testing. But in this case it would still be necessary to test all of those in a group every 12 days, in order to bring R’ down to 0.75. If scarce testing is to be allocated over individuals with different prior probabilities of infection, these formulas can be used to optimize the allocation. If we take the simplest form of our periodic testing model, when α = 0, for high frequency testing where an individual has a test after a smaller number of days than the length of an infection (N<d), then equation (3) simplifies to: Suppose that individual k has prior probability pk  of infection and that we wish to choose Nk so as to allocate a given amount of testing over a set of individuals so as to maximally reduce R’. Then, using frequent testing where an individual has a test after a smaller number of days than the length of an infection (N<d), the optimal allocation of a given amount of testing should choose Nk ∝ 1/ pk. This shows very clearly that there are diminishing returns to making N very small—that is conducting more frequent tests results in diminishing reductions in R’. The amount of testing allocated, therefore, to higher-risk individuals is naturally higher, but not proportionately so. Periodic testing periods of around 6 days may be sufficient to control the propagation of infection on their own. This is testing approximately 17 per cent of the population each day. This figure is highly sensitive to changes in self-isolation behaviour and the characteristics of the test being administered. Our model moves us towards a useful framework for determining the frequency with which a subgroup need be tested. For any particular subgroup, the frequency of testing which is required to reduce transmission sufficiently is determined by the both the subgroup’s properties and the properties of the test. A group’s key factors are the capability of its individuals to self-isolate if symptomatic, and the initial propagation rate  R0. The important figures for the test are the speed of results and the accuracy with which it reports positive results. Our model shows the way in which all of these factors can be traded off against one another. We assume that the whole population is randomly tested. We let t be the proportion of the population tested each day and then isolated if they are infected. As in section IV we assume patients are infectious for d =14 days, symptomatic cases show symptoms and self-isolate after d0 = 5 days, but that only half are themselves symptomatic, i.e. α = 0.5. Of these tests we assume that 30 per cent return false negative results, i.e. that n = 0.3. We also assume ‘instant isolation’, where an infectious person is isolated immediately on the day that they receive a positive test result, and so are not able to infect others, even on that day. In practice this would mean an early morning test with rapid results. This is different from our assumption in section IV, where we assumed ‘delayed isolation’ so that patients remain able to infect others on the day of their test, and only begin to isolate on the next day. We think delayed isolation is a more plausible assumption. But we assume instant isolation in this section so as to make our results more nearly comparable with those of Romer (2020a,b). Nevertheless we extend our analysis to consider the case of universal random testing with delayed isolation in section V(iv). Our calculations proceed as follows. We consider the impact of an infectious person on others when he or she has a probability t of being tested each day, and so of being placed in isolation immediately if the test is positive. For clarity, it is helpful to think about the ‘discovery rate’ x, where x = t(1 – n) and n is the number of tests which show false negatives, which we take to be n = 0.3. The variable x shows the probability that, on any day on which this person is infectious, he or she is isolated. This means that (1 – x) is the probability that this person will not be isolated, and so be able to infect people on that day and subsequent days. If there were no self-isolation of those who became symptomatic, then the probability of an infectious person remaining undetected on day j is (1 – x)j and the expected number of infections caused by an infected person on day j is rj. Therefore, in expectation, an infected person would infect r1(1−x) persons on day 1 of their infection,    r2(1− x)2 persons on day 2, and so on, up to    r14(1− x)14 persons on the final day d. We assume that the infection rate is constant over the infected period and so rj=R0/d. We allow for self-isolation by letting the proportion who are symptomatic, α, self-isolate after 5 days. So, only a proportion (1 – α) go on being tested from day 6 onwards. We can thus write our key equation as follows: or, in more compact notation: Our ambition is to get to a position where each infectious person only infects 0.75 other people on average, so that the virus dies out. We seek to find the value of x which would achieve this. Recalling that R0 = 2.5, and letting d = 14, we then can solve for x in equation (8): or, in more concise notation, The solution to this equation can be obtained numerically16 for various values of α. When α = 0.5, as roughly observed in Iceland, x ≈ 0.146. But t = x/(1 – n). And n, the proportion of false negatives, is equal to 0.3. So the required probability of testing on each day, t, is given by t = 0.146/0.7 ≈ 0.209. That is to say, the proportion of people tested on any day must be as high as 21 per cent in order to achieve the required 14.6 per cent discovery rate x. Recall from equation (1) that R’ = (1 – φ)R0, where φ is the proportion of the infectious population which is isolated. With R0 = 2.5 and R’ = 0.75, this means that φ = 0.7. Thus, over the 14 days in which a person is infectious, this person will, on average, be in isolation for 70 per cent of the time. We have shown that to achieve such a very striking outcome, the probability of testing an infected person who is not yet isolated on any day must be at least 21 per cent. With random, population-wide testing, this means, in effect, that everybody in the population has to be tested about every 5 days. The dotted line in Figure 2 plots R’ as a function of the proportion of the population tested, under Universal Random Testing. As we have already seen, when half of those who are infected self-isolate from day 6 onwards, i.e. α = 0.5, t needs to be equal to about 21 per cent to get R’ down to 0.75. More than this, the figure also displays the different testing rates which are required to obtain a range of different values for R’. And it does this for different values of α as well. \\nFigure 2 enables us to identify the threshold testing rates, t* that reduce R’ to exactly 1, and so just stop the epidemic from exploding.17For α = 0.5, this threshold testing rate is t* = 13 per cent. To achieve this, everyone would need to be tested, on average, every 8 days. This is still way above Romer’s proposed testing rate of 7 per cent. Figure 2 also displays the sensitivity of the results to various values of α, the proportion of infected people who display symptoms and self-isolate. It shows that, at one extreme, when all cases are symptomatic after 5 days and then self-isolate (i.e. when α = 1.00), the situation seems just about manageable: the epidemic would stop exploding even without any testing. Nevertheless, the required value of t which would ensure that R’ = 0.75, is about 8.2 per cent. This percentage is actually a little above that proposed by Romer because infected asymptomatic people do a lot of damage in the first 5 days! At the other extreme, with α = 0.00, the situation is much worse: the probability of testing per day, t*, which is required to stop the epidemic exploding is now nearly 20 per cent (19.1 per cent) and the value of t required to ensure that R’ = 0.75 is about 26 per cent (26.1 per cent). Data for the extent to which infectious people become symptomatic is currently extremely unreliable and furthermore the range of possibilities seems very wide. Even if over half of infected people self-isolate, around 20 per cent of the population would need to be tested every day to get R’ to 0.75. The outcomes depicted in Figure 2 suggest that, on the balance of probabilities, universal random testing would be unworkable. Returning to the share of asymptomatic cases observed in Iceland (i.e. the case when α = 0.5), Figure 2 shows that by setting a testing rate of 7 per cent of the population, as advocated by Romer (2020b), the epidemic actually remains explosive with R’ equal to about 1.3. In this situation, infection would spread rapidly in the earlier stages, since the testing rate is not high enough to control and eliminate the disease; all testing would do is slow down the inevitable spread of the disease. It is clear that the speed at which the disease spreads depends not only on R’, but also on the number of days, d, for which infected individuals remain infectious, and on whether infectiousness is spread evenly over the time of infection—as assumed here—or is instead concentrated in the early days of infection. Obviously as the disease spreads, the number of people susceptible to infection begins to fall, and then to fall rapidly. Ultimately, the fact that more and more people have had the disease and so are immune will bring the spread to an end and the proportion of those who have been infected will tend towards a constant level which has become known as the ‘herd immunity’ proportion. It can be shown, for any R, that this proportion is given by (1 – 1/R).18 Without testing, and a value of R0 of 2.5, the herd immunity proportion is as high as 60 per cent. Universal random testing (as advocated by Romer (2020a,b)) of 7 per cent of the population per day would reduce R’ to 1.3, and so reduce the herd immunity proportion, to which the population is tending in the long run, to about 23 per cent. But in the earlier stages of infection, when there is almost no immunity, the disease would still spread rapidly as the testing rate would not be high enough to slow the spread in a controlled manner, particularly if each person infected other people quickly. Thus, in sum, we can say that universal random testing at this rate would only slow the spread (or ‘flatten the curve’), but would not control the initial explosive phase of the epidemic. It would not stop very large numbers of people being infected. This is therefore a risky strategy. Peak levels of infection might rise beyond the capacity of the health system to deal with the epidemic. Even if testing rates were then increased, lags in responses would mean that the spread of infection would only be gradually reduced. Meanwhile, the virus would go on spreading towards the herd immunity level. Of course, there are many changes to our assumptions which could modify our calculations. In particular, there would be significant reductions in required testing rates if whole households were to be self-isolated in the event that anyone in the household tested positive. If, for example, only one person in a household were tested at any time, and households consisted on average of two people, then each positive test would remove two people into isolation. That is, testing would become more effective. On the other hand, our calculations have deliberately assumed that anyone testing positive immediately isolates themselves, and so is not infectious on the day of the test. Using the more cautious assumption that those testing positive are only isolated on the following day, and so only stop infecting other people then, equation (8a) now becomes: or, in more concise notation: The results found using this equation are much worse than those described in section V(i). With α = 0.5, the critical testing rate, t*, is now 16 per cent, and the testing rate required to get R’ down to 0.75 is now as high as 27 per cent. A bit over a quarter of the population would need to be tested every day! We can now compare the benefits of stratified periodic testing with those of universal random testing. In section IV and Figure 1 we showed that under stratified periodic testing with half of cases being asymptomatic, a 30 per cent false negative rate, and isolation the day after a positive test, the testing rate needed to bring R down from R0 =2.5 to R’=0.75 would be 17 per cent of the population each day (or testing each person every 6 days). In section V(iv) we showed that under universal random testing, using the same assumptions, the required testing rate would be 27 per cent, or testing each person about every 4 days. This is a 37 per cent reduction in the number of people needing to be tested each day—the same impact on D’ for a significantly reduced cost. The advantages of stratified periodic testing are robust to other assumptions. If we assume that people immediately self-isolate after testing positive, and so are not infectious on the day of their test, then we would only need to test 13.4 per cent of the population per day to achieve R’=0.75 (as shown in Appendix 1 and Figure 3), versus 21 per cent of the population per day under universal random testing (as shown in section V(i) and Figure 2). If, instead, we assume that the tests return zero false negatives (n=0), but people are infectious on the day of their test, then we must test 12 per cent of the population each day under stratified periodic testing to achieve R’=0.75, versus 19 per cent under universal random testing. We conclude that for the universal random testing proposed to be workable (which would require testing, say, less than 10 per cent of the population per day) policy-makers would require confidence that: Unfortunately, we do not feel that all these conditions can be met given our current state of knowledge about the virus. So, we do not believe that whole-population random testing would be a good use of resources. Instead, stratified periodic testing is both workable, and an efficient use of finite testing resources. This paper proposes ‘stratified periodic testing’ as a strategy for ensuring that R’ < 1 and so preventing an explosive re-emergence of COVID-19. Such a strategy is necessary for lockdown to be ended and for economies to return to work. The testing would be ‘stratified’, in the sense that it would focus on specific subsets of the population who currently have the highest reproduction number R. The criteria for choosing who would be tested could be amended to also take into account the vulnerability of subgroups, or the loss of economic activity if they are forced to self-isolate at home. This ensures that infected people can be identified and isolated quickly. The testing would be ‘periodic’, in the sense that each member of the subset would be tested at regular, defined intervals, rather than testing within the group being done at random. Those who test positive would be quickly isolated at home, as would anyone with symptoms. The tests need not be perfect: if they are cheap but deployed widely within particular groups, then false negatives can be offset by increasing the frequency of testing. The effectiveness of the programme can be improved by simple tracing of the contacts of those infected: for example testing those in their workplaces and households, rather than fully tracking mobile-phone movements with the associated privacy concerns. It would also be improved by ensuring that all members of a household are isolated if any member tests positive. We argue that this is better than ‘universal random testing’ which is currently being discussed in many places. Romer (2020a,b) suggests that by testing 7 per cent of the population every day we can get the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 to around 0.75 and thereby curb the epidemic. Unfortunately, Romer’s calculations contain errors. By correcting his method, and using reasonable assumptions about asymptomatic carriers, we believe that, if this strategy were followed, at least 21 per cent of the population would need to be tested each day to get the effective reproduction number down to well below 1 (e.g. to a value of 0.75). For obvious reasons, we do not see this as a feasible population-wide strategy. Any testing strategy should be thought of as a complement to other measures that can reduce the spread of COVID-19 at little economic cost. For example, those who can work from home with little loss of productivity should continue to do so, retirees should continue to self-isolate, and people in public places should wear masks and regularly wash their hands. A process of stratified periodic testing might well become part of a strategy of ensuring that workers can get back to work quickly and safely in sectors of the economy in which work cannot be performed at home. This process should continue until widespread vaccines or treatment for the virus are available.'}},\n",

       "     'abstract-full': \"An important component of every country's COVID-19 response is fast and efficient testing -- to identify and isolate cases, as well as for early detection of local hotspots. For many countries, producing a sufficient number of tests has been a serious limiting factor in their efforts to control COVID-19 infections. Group testing is a well-established mathematical tool, which can provide a serious and rapid improvement to this situation. In this note, we compare several well-established group testing schemes in the context of qPCR testing for COVID-19. We include example calculations, where we indicate which testing architectures yield the greatest efficiency gains in various settings. We find that for identification of individuals with COVID-19, array testing is usually the best choice, while for estimation of COVID-19 prevalence rates in the total population, Gibbs-Gower testing usually provides the most accurate estimates given a fixed and relatively small number of tests. This note is intended as a helpful handbook for labs implementing group testing methods.\",\n",

The mainstay of diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 is molecular polymerase chain reaction testing of a respiratory specimen, obtained with a viral swab. As the incidence of new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 increases exponentially, the use of viral swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimens is anticipated to increase drastically. CASE REPORT: This paper draws attention to a complication of viral swab testing in the nasopharynx and describes the premature engagement of a viral swab breakpoint, resulting in impaction in the nasal cavity. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a possible design flaw of the viral swab when used to collect nasopharyngeal specimens, which then requires an aerosol-generating procedure in a high-risk patient to be performed. The paper outlines a safe technique of nasal foreign body removal in a suspected coronavirus disease 2019 patient and suggests alternative testing materials.',\n",

       "     'abstract-full': 'BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019, a highly transmissible respiratory infection, has created a public health crisis of global magnitude. The mainstay of diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 is molecular polymerase chain reaction testing of a respiratory specimen, obtained with a viral swab. As the incidence of new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 increases exponentially, the use of viral swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimens is anticipated to increase drastically. CASE REPORT: This paper draws attention to a complication of viral swab testing in the nasopharynx and describes the premature engagement of a viral swab breakpoint, resulting in impaction in the nasal cavity. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a possible design flaw of the viral swab when used to collect nasopharyngeal specimens, which then requires an aerosol-generating procedure in a high-risk patient to be performed. The paper outlines a safe technique of nasal foreign body removal in a suspected coronavirus disease 2019 patient and suggests alternative testing materials.',\n",
       "     'body_text-full': \"Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a respiratory infection in humans that was first identified as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan city, China, in December 2019.1,2 The offending pathogen is a novel coronavirus, isolated on 7th January 2020, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).2 The clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic, to a mild upper respiratory infection, to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory failure and death.2 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Covid-19 pandemic on 11th March 2020.3 Diagnostic testing plays a crucial role in outbreak initial detection, containment, effective isolation and eventual resolution.4 A male nursing home resident in his late seventies presented to the emergency department after an unwitnessed fall, unable to mobilise. He had a background of severe dementia and chronic kidney disease. He was diagnosed with a right-sided neck of femur fracture. He was admitted and underwent an uncomplicated right-sided hemi-arthroplasty. Three days post-operatively, he developed a low grade fever. He was suspected of having Covid-19 as he had been in contact with other patients on the ward who had subsequently tested positive for the virus. The patient lacked capacity and was uncooperative whilst undergoing a nasopharyngeal swab test for Covid-19. Despite gentle restraint from a trained healthcare assistant, rapid head movements resulted in the engagement of the swab breakpoint mechanism, whilst the swab was still in the nasal cavity. The swab was retained in the nose out of direct vision. The ENT registrar was called to retrieve the swab. The patient underwent a bedside examination with a flexible nasendoscope. A nasal swab stick was found in the right nasal cavity, under the inferior turbinate on the floor, midway in the nasal cavity (Figure 1). Retrieval of an 8 cm swab was performed with minimal trauma under direct vision using Tilley's dressing forceps.\\n The swab tested positive for Covid-19 and the patient was transferred to a ring-fenced Covid-19 ward. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has an affinity for respiratory epithelium. Zou et al. compared throat and nasal swabs, and found higher viral loads in the nose compared to the throat.5 Liu et al. found that patients with severe Covid-19 harboured a greater viral load and a longer virus-shedding period in the nasopharynx compared to mild cases.6 The primary means of diagnosing Covid-19 at present is via molecular testing to detect viral RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.7 Clinical suspicion and several laboratory findings may raise the probability of Covid-19, including decreased albumin, raised C-reactive protein, high lactate dehydrogenase, lymphopenia, high aspartate transaminase and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate.8 Chest radiographs show bilateral changes, often ground-glass opacification.8 Computed tomography changes include multifocal bilateral or isolated round ground-glass opacity with or without patchy consolidations, prominent peripherally and in the posterior or lower lobe.9 The viral specimen swabs used in our unit are Sigma Virocult®.10 They consist of two components, a plastic swab, which incorporates a breakpoint halfway down the shaft of the swab, and a Sigma Swab® tip (an open-celled foam bud) to capture the specimen (Figure 2). This specially designed tip is reported to provide optimum uptake and release of micro-organisms, and allow flow of the sample through the reagents used in the testing process, in comparison to a standard swab that uses either a cotton or rayon spun fibre tip.\\n The swab is then inserted into a plastic tube containing a viral transport medium (Figure 2). The manufacturer reports that this medium aids the survival of many types of common viruses, either at room temperature or refrigerated, stabilising the viral particles and utilising antimicrobial agents to prevent the growth of either bacteria or fungi that may also be present on the swab.10 The ENT-specific swab types are produced by Sigma for application in the nasopharynx.10 They utilise a finer tip and narrower shaft at the tip end of the swab. These swabs also incorporate a breakpoint feature.10 The breakpoint mechanism prevents contamination whilst transferring the shaft into the bottle; however, this feature makes the swab susceptible to fracture whilst still in the nasal cavity, as illustrated in our case. This situation could arise in non-cooperative patients, such as those with advanced dementia or severe learning difficulties, and in patients with anatomical variations (e.g. septal deviations and spurs). Head or limb movements can easily lead to the swab breaking and the swab tip being lost in the nasal cavity. If this does occur, further aerosol-generating procedures, such as flexible nasendoscopy and manual retrieval with surgical instruments, may be required in an already challenging patient. Foreign body removal from the nose is an aerosol-generating procedure and therefore warrants robust personal protective equipment, in line with ENT UK and NHS England guidance.11,12 Covid-19 precautions also include the examination and therapeutic intervention being delivered in a ‘one-stop’ episode, limiting the location, frequency and personnel to a single episode, to reduce the risk to the patient, nearby patients and healthcare staff.11 In order to optimise the success and retrieval of a nasal foreign body in a Covid-19 patient, and reduce the risk of aerosol generation, we recommend the application of a pledget soaked in vasoconstrictor and local anaesthetic solution to the nasal cavity, to reduce mucosal oedema and desensitise nasal mucosa prior to anterior rhinoscopy. Intranasal spray should be avoided, as this may induce aerosolisation.13 Initially, anterior rhinoscopy may be carried out with a Thudicum nasal speculum, to accentuate the internal nasal valve area, the narrowest cross-sectional area of the nose. Foreign bodies deep to the internal valve require examination with a rigid or flexible nasendoscope. Close face-to-face proximity should be avoided where possible, and therefore nasal endoscopy should be carried out with a video display as per ENT UK guidance.13 Although the rigid scope is preferable, as it enables a single operator to handle both the scope and surgical instruments, it should be avoided in an uncooperative patient. A flexible nasendoscope requires two hands to operate and therefore an assistant is required for foreign body removal (Figure 3).\\n We opted to use a flexible nasendoscope with an assistant. Although this increased personnel exposure, we aimed to remove the swab at the patient's bedside in one single episode, to avoid the patient undergoing a general anaesthetic. Instrumentation to remove the foreign body is dictated by the item in question, and in this situation, we used Tilley's nasal dressing forceps to retrieve the nasal swab (Figure 3). A retained foreign body post-procedure is a ‘never event’,14 and must be prevented at all costs. In a patient with a potential Covid-19 infection, a retained nasal swab not only poses a risk to the patient but also to healthcare staff, and the ensuing aerosol-generating procedures required to remove it further increase the risk of disease transmission to healthcare staff. The simplest way to avoid this complication is to utilise a product without a breakpoint. Based on the information from WHO15 and other sources,16,17 there are several alternative products for viral sampling that are readily available on the market, or already in use in the clinical environment, that do not have the breakpoint feature. The use of alternative swabs, either dry or transported with a small amount of sterile saline, may provide a useful alternative in patients at risk of experiencing premature breaking of the viral swab shaft in the nasal cavity. This is supported by the WHO guidance, which suggests that nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab products with Dacron® or polyester flocked swabs can be used, and if viral transport medium is unavailable, then sterile saline may be used in replacement.15 It must be noted that when there is likely to be a delay in specimens reaching the laboratory, the use of viral transport medium is strongly recommended by WHO.15 Druce et al. demonstrated that dry swabs, transported in either saline or dry, had similar efficacy in detecting various viruses as purpose-specific viral swabs that were sent in either universal transport medium or specific viral transport medium.16 Moore et al. revealed that the use of dry swabs with no transport medium was not only a suitable alternative, but it also produced a higher detection rate of respiratory viruses by using real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, compared to more traditional methods of detection.17\\n\\n•Viral swab sticks generally have a breakpoint feature•Premature activation of the breakpoint in a complex group of patients can lead to a retained swab tip in the nasal cavity•Nasal foreign body removal is an aerosol-generating procedure and requires robust personal protective equipment•The simplest way to avoid this complication is to utilise a product without a breakpoint•Alternative swab products with Dacron or polyester flocked tips can be used, and if viral transport medium is unavailable, then sterile saline may be used in replacement We suggest that hospitals liaise with their local microbiology laboratory and seek alternative arrangements for swab testing if concerned about premature breakage in vulnerable patients. We have described a novel adverse event encountered with a Covid-19 viral swab. The patient was subjected to an aerosol-generating procedure to remove the nasal swab from the nasal cavity. The viral swab has an intrinsic design feature that gives rise to this complication. We have outlined appropriate techniques to address this complication and suggested a solution to circumvent this problem, which may be useful in a complex subset of suspected Covid-19 patients.\",\n",

       "     'abstract-full': 'OBJECTIVES To identify whether the scratch test can be used as an alternative to the Weber\\'s test after tympanomastoid surgery. METHODS This twin-center prospective study assessed major tympanomastoid surgery patients over a 6-month period. Patients were assessed postoperatively on Day 0 or Day 1 of surgery using a standardized proforma. A Weber\\'s test was performed using a 512-Hz tuning fork, placed midline on the forehead to assess the direction of sound localization. This was directly compared with a scratch test, by asking the patient the following while scratching the head bandage in the midline: \"Can you hear this? And which side is loudest?\" RESULTS Fifty-six patients were assessed in total. Sixteen mastoid explorations, 14 tympanoplasties, 18 combined approach tympanoplasties, and 8 other procedures were included, all of which had standard external auditory canal packing and head bandage. Assessment with Weber\\'s test found 41 patients to have sound lateralizing to the operated ear. In comparison, 50 patients lateralized sound to the operated ear with the scratch test. Overall, Weber\\'s test had a sensitivity of 73.2% and specificity of 100% compared with a sensitivity of 89.3% and specificity of 100% for the \"Scratch Test.\" No patients had a dead ear after surgery. CONCLUSION The scratch test proved to be more accurate than traditional postoperative tuning fork assessment and provides a quick, accurate, and simple solution for when such equipment is unavailable.',\n",

       "     'abstract-full': \"Large scale disease screening is a complicated process in which high costs must be balanced against pressing public health needs. When the goal is screening for infectious disease, one approach is group testing in which samples are initially tested in pools and individual samples are retested only if the initial pooled test was positive. Intuitively, if the prevalence of infection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number of tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies has been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the accuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing the issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume that the misclassification parameters are known from an external population and/or that the values do not change with the group size. Both of these assumptions are highly questionable for many medical practitioners considering group testing in their study design. In this article, we explore how the failure of these assumptions might impact the efficacy of a group testing design and, consequently, whether group testing is currently feasible for medical screening. Specifically, we look at how incorrect assumptions about the sensitivity function at the design stage can lead to poor estimation of a procedure's overall sensitivity and expected number of tests. Furthermore, if a validation study is used to estimate the pooled misclassification parameters of a given assay, we show that the sample sizes required are so large as to be prohibitive in all but the largest screening programs\"}},\n",

However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck, especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore, requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.'}},\n",

At our disposal is a testing procedure that allows us to test several individuals together. In an idealized setting, a test is positive if and only if at least one infected individual is included and negative otherwise. Significant progress was made in recent years towards understanding the information-theoretic and algorithmic properties in this noiseless setting. In this paper, we consider a noisy variant of group testing where test results are flipped with certain probability, including the realistic scenario where sensitivity and specificity can take arbitrary values. Using a test design where each individual is assigned to a fixed number of tests, we derive explicit algorithmic bounds for two commonly considered inference algorithms and thereby improve on results by Scarlett \\\\&Cevher (SODA 2016) and Scarlett \\\\&Johnson (2020) and providing the strongest performance guarantees currently proved for efficient algorithms in these noisy group testing models.',\n",

We call this ‘stratified periodic testing’. It is ‘stratified’ as it is based on at-risk groups, and ‘periodic’ as everyone in the group is tested at regular intervals. We argue that this is a better use of scarce testing resources than ‘universal random testing’, as has been recently discussed globally. We find that, under reasonable assumptions and allowing for false negative results 30 per cent of the time, 17 per cent of a subgroup would need to be tested each day to lower the effective reproduction number R from 2.5 to 0.75, under stratified periodic testing. Using the same assumptions the universal random testing rate would need to be 27 per cent (as opposed to 7 per cent as argued by Romer (2020b)). We obtain this rate of testing using a corrected method for calculating the impact of an infectious person on others, and allowing for asymptomatic cases. We also find that the effect of one day’s delay between testing positive and self-isolating is similar to having a test that is 30 per cent less accurate.',\n",

Given these constraints, we argue that ‘stratified periodic testing’ is an efficient way of using scarce testing resources, and provides a way for calculating the frequency of testing needed to stop the spread of the virus within a particular group. We also argue that our method is more efficient than ‘universal random testing’, which has been widely discussed since it was proposed by Romer (2020b). Our proposal is ‘stratified’ because it focuses testing on groups who are at particular risk of spreading the infection. This may be because they have a high basic reproduction number, R0, to begin with, like healthcare workers. Or, it may be because they have a high reproduction number because of the way lockdown has been unevenly applied, for example delivery drivers remaining active. The choice of groups may also take into account fatality rates if they were to spread the virus (like those in care homes for the elderly), or the economic impact if the group needed to be isolated (as discussed by Kasy and Teytelboym (2020)). Constraints on testing capacity mean that this is a more workable and efficient solution than testing the entire population. We also propose that tests should be ‘periodic’, rather than random. This ensures that each member of the group is certain to be tested at regular intervals, which improves the efficiency of testing. For example, it can prevent some individuals being tested on two successive days, and others having to wait a disproportionate length of time to be re-tested. We show that this increases the efficiency of any given number of tests by approximately 37 per cent, at no extra cost. Using this approach we find that, under plausible assumptions, 17 per cent of a group would need to be tested each day to reduce the virus’s reproduction rate from R0=2.5 to R’=0.75 (see section IV). This allows for half the cases to be symptomatic, and therefore self-isolating after 5 days. It also allows for people to be infectious on the day of their test, and for 30 per cent of tests to return false negative results. If there are no false negatives, or if people are not infectious on the day they test positive (which we think would be difficult to achieve in practice), then the required testing rate would be 12–13 per cent per day. Naturally, even less testing would be required if it were to be accompanied by low-cost interventions (e.g. face masks) that reduce the group’s initial R0. To set our results in context, we also consider ‘universal random testing’. This was proposed by Romer (2020a,b), who argued that randomly testing 7 per cent of the entire population every day would be sufficient to bring the effective reproduction number down to R’=0.75. In this proposal he made the important point that the economic benefit of a speedier recovery would be measured in $trillions and this would easily justify spending $billions on testing; he also argued that it is not necessary for such testing to be highly accurate. Unfortunately, as we show, Romer’s calculations did not allow for asymptomatic cases, or delays in isolation, and also contained an error. Using a corrected model we find that universal random testing would require 27 per cent of the population to be tested each day—an impossible task. So long as testing remains a scarce and relatively expensive resource, we argue that testing of the general population should be reserved for two purposes. Informational tests will help identify the groups that need to be included in stratified periodic testing, though the samples required for this will be very small relative to the size of the whole population. Antibody tests would allow those that have been infected to get back to work, providing that those who have been infected turn out to be immune to future infection. The paper is organized as follows. Section II lays out our objective of reducing the effective reproduction rate down to R’=0.75, and section III describes our strategy for achieving this: stratified periodic testing. Section IV then describes how to calculate the testing rate needed in a particular subgroup to achieve the objective. Section V calculates the testing rates needed to achieve the same objective under universal random testing, under a variety of assumptions. Section VI compares the results of the two methods, while section VII concludes. In Appendix 1 we derive the testing rate required to achieve R’=0.75 under stratified periodic testing, if people are not infectious on the day they test positive. Appendix 2 considers two papers by Romer (Romer, 2020a,b) which argue in favour of universal random testing, and shows why we think that these papers contain an error. Appendix 3 provides a simple formula which can be used to support the conclusions in the body of the paper that universal random testing strategy would not control the spread of the virus, and which also provides some simple intuition as to what would be required for that strategy to work. The reproduction number R in an epidemic is the expected number of cases directly generated by any one infectious case. The basic reproduction number, R0, is the initial value of R.1 We assume that the value of R0 for the whole population is R0 = 2.5 (following Romer, 2020a,b). When R0, > 1, the speed at which the disease spreads depends not only on that value of R0, but also on the rapidity of transmission, and—in particular—on the number of days for which an infected individual remains infectious, and on whether the infectiousness of an individual is particularly great during the early days of his or her infection. It is clear that an epidemic can only be prevented from spreading by a policy which creates an effective reproduction number, R’ (R prime), of less than 1. When that happens, each infected person will infect less than one new person, and the epidemic will die out. If the value of R’ is brought down to a number well below 1 then the epidemic will die out quickly. In our calculations below we explore the effect of a policy designed to produce an effective reproduction number R’ of 0.75. Our means of doing this will be to test some subset of the population each day and then to isolate those who are found to be infected. The effective reproduction number R’ in these circumstances is the product of the basic reproductive number, R0, and the fraction of the infectious population that is not isolated. We have chosen the number 0.75 because this was the number chosen by Romer (2020b). Let φ be the proportion of the infectious population which is isolated. Then we can write Equation (1): To achieve an objective of R’ = 0.75 when R0 = 2.5, Equation (1) implies that that φ = 0.7, i.e. that 70 per cent of the infectious population is isolated, and that sufficient tests and isolation are carried out to make this possible. We argue that testing should be carried out at different frequencies for different stratified groups, based on their likelihood of infecting others. This likelihood can be deduced from their occupation, geography, likely behaviour when not isolated, and other factors.3 Testing at rates above 20 per cent per day could be done for carefully selected groups which have a high basic reproduction number (R0) relative to others. Doing that would enable greater rates of isolation in these groups, lowering their effective reproduction number (R’) and helping to prevent the epidemic spreading where it matters most.4 Identifying high-risk groups and testing them frequently appears to be a much lower-risk strategy for containing the spread of infection than randomly testing the entire population (which we consider in sections V and VI). The strategy being advocated here would be easier to pursue if cheap tests were used, even ones that were somewhat inaccurate.5 Broadly, there are two types of people who are likely to have a particularly high basic reproduction number relative to others. The first are those who have a high basic reproduction number to begin with. These are individuals who would have been more likely to infect others, before the infection had begun to spread and any policy interventions had been adopted. Members of large religious congregations are one example, because of their tendency to meet in large groups indoors. Doctors are another, as they have very frequent and unavoidable close contact with others. Their basic reproduction number will, as a result, be very high and very frequent testing will be necessary to ensure that their effective reproduction number is low enough. As a result, there could be very frequent testing for doctors in hospitals to ensure that the effective reproduction rate for them is brought well below 1. It appears likely that the relevant calculations will show that doctors actually need to be tested every day. But there are also other people who will have a high basic reproduction number because of the uneven application of the lockdown and other factors that might affect variation in infectiousness across groups.6 For many people, for instance, lockdown means that they are confined to their homes (including many workers who are able to work from home), reducing their basic reproduction number to well below 1. But key workers, who are encouraged to keep working in spite of the lockdown, will have a higher basic reproduction number as a result (e.g. those involved in food production and distribution). The same will be true for all those who are unable to work from home and are given permission to avoid the lockdown (e.g. those involved in construction and manufacturing). Another group that is likely to have a higher basic reproduction number is those who are more exposed to people who are particularly susceptible to the infection (e.g. prison warders and care workers). As testing is rolled out it will become increasingly appropriate to test all such people frequently. One challenge in all this is that the basic reproduction number may be high in particular groups for idiosyncratic reasons that are hard to anticipate. The kinds of calculation described in the next section could easily be carried out for structured samples in different locations, in order to identify these pockets of infectiousness. The general principle, then, is that testing should be concentrated in groups that have high reproduction numbers relative to others, in the current state of the world. But this principle should not be interpreted too strictly. In certain cases, other criteria may also be important: for instance, we may want to regularly test groups that interact with those who are more likely to die from the infection (this is another reason to test care workers more frequently) or groups whose absence would have a greater economic impact than others (see Kasy and Teytelboym, 2020). Universal random testing is an alternative regime that has been widely discussed recently (see Romer, 2020b; Long, 2020; Chotiner, 2020). This approach involves, after prioritizing some of the most important groups,7 mass testing for the whole population, in order to get the effective reproduction number down for the whole population. This testing is also random, rather than at pre-specified periods. The approach is summarized in a Twitter thread which concludes as follows: Instead, we argue that testing must be focused on particular groups. This is because our findings, discussed in section V below, show that a mass testing plan would still leave the effective reproduction number significantly above 1 unless it was carried out infeasibly frequently. Nevertheless, there will still need to be random testing of groups in the population, and some random testing of the whole population. But this testing would be for informational purposes only and would only involve testing very small samples of those involved. Such informational testing will be needed for two reasons. First, random testing of small samples from particular groups will be necessary to track groups in which the basic reproduction number is already known to be high, and where there is greater potential for a high rate of spread. Once identified, these groups will then need very frequent testing of everyone in the group, for the reasons which we have been discussing in this paper. But testing of small samples of wider groups in the whole population will also be needed to identify new groups where the basic reproduction number is high. As before, this may be for idiosyncratic reasons that are hard to anticipate. Once identified, such groups will then also need very frequent testing of everyone in the group. But the accuracy of this testing for informational reasons will be determined by the sample size, rather than population size. The samples required for these informational purposes will be very small relative to the size of the whole population. Once the frequency of testing has been decided and testing kits are available, testing can begin for everyone in the identified groups. But it is important that this testing be done periodically for each person, rather than there being a random choice of those who are to be tested in each time period. The rationale underlying periodic testing can be explained by the ‘waiting-time paradox’.9 Random testing, say, of 20 per cent of a group each day, wastes many resources. This is because every day some of those tested will have actually been tested the day before, while others of those who are infectious will, nevertheless, not be tested and so will possibly continue infecting people. By contrast, periodic testing of 20 per cent of a group means that, on days 1 to 5, a different fifth of the group will be tested each day, and that on day 6 the first fifth of the group will tested again, and so on. It is clear that this means each person tested will have been tested exactly 5 days previously, removing the problem that some tests are being wasted and that other tests are being postponed for too long. Because of this, you need to test far fewer individuals in a group to get the same reduction in R. In section VI, we provide a simple account of this issue, and show how important it is likely to be. We show that with high testing rates, periodic testing beats random testing by a very significant factor. In this paper, we have been discussing diagnostic testing (i.e. testing for active infections) as opposed to antibody testing (i.e. testing for those who have had the disease and are both immune and non-infectious). A combination of the two types of testing might be effective and realistic if the diagnostic testing capacity remains constrained, but antibody tests become widely available. One might then proceed as follows. All of this could be done using cheap diagnostic tests, even if they were somewhat inaccurate. It is not the case that ‘no test is better than an unreliable test’. Our calculations show that, while accurate tests are absolutely necessary for clinical reasons when treating an individual person, much more rough-and-ready testing is satisfactory if the purpose of this testing is epidemiological control through isolation. (In our baseline calculations discussed below, for instance, we assume that 30 per cent of infected people wrongly test negative.) Doing all of this will help governments to track the spread and to determine where hotspots are flaring up. Such information will help them to work out how to selectively tighten, or loosen, containment measures when needed. Such a testing procedure would involve doing two things at once: the stratified periodic diagnostic testing which we have been discussing would be designed to dampen the spread of the disease in key groups, by catching those in these groups who were infectious but asymptomatic, or pre-symptomatic, or post-symptomatic, and so not self-isolating. At the same time, antibody testing for the entire population would separate out the immune population. Passing an antibody test would enable such people to return to work. Having described what stratified periodic testing looks like, we now derive more formal results for the testing rate required to get R down to R’ = 0.75, and the testing ‘threshold’ at which R’ = 1. In section V we go on to show that periodic testing is about 37 per cent more effective than random testing, at no extra cost. We assume that the number of days an infected person is infectious is d = 14, following Romer (2020b). Fourteen days is familiar in the analysis of COVID-19 as the period after which the person is either dead or—much more likely—recovered, but no longer infectious.12 For simplicity we also assume that there is uniform contagion throughout the 14-day period. So, if R0 = 2.5, and if there were no testing which led to the isolation of infected people, then an infectious person would infect 2.5 people in total, or 2.5/d persons per day over a period of d days. The results which follow obviously depend both on our assumed value of d and on our assumption that the infectiousness of an individual is not disproportionately great during the early days of his or her infection.13 In almost all countries, an important part of the current policy response to COVID-19 is that those who show symptoms are required to self-isolate. Because of this, only asymptomatic people and those who have chosen not to self-isolate, for example with mild or mistaken symptoms, will be spreading the disease, and will be included in those who are tested. We assume that all of those infected are asymptomatic for 5 days (and are subject to testing during that time). After 5 days a proportion of the population, α, displays symptoms and self-isolates. This means that only a proportion (1 – α) go on infecting others, and being tested, from day 6 onwards. The proportion of asymptomatic patients isn’t really known, and estimates vary wildly. The World Health Organization suggests that as many as 80 per cent of cases are asymptomatic or mild. Very inexact data from Iceland suggest that all infectious patients are asymptomatic for the first 5 days and that, after this time, only about half become symptomatic. We use these Icelandic figures when constructing the ‘base case’ in our calculations, so α = 0.5. Following Romer (2020b) we allow for the tests to return false negatives. We let n be the proportion of false negatives and assume that n=0.3 (i.e. 30 per cent of those who are infected test negative). We let R’ be the expected number of people that a randomly chosen infected person infects before that person is positively tested (or stops being infective, if sooner). Let rj be the expected number of people infected by an individual on day j of his/her infection, for j =1, 2,...,d where the length of infectivity is d. Thus R′=∑dj=1rj   . Now suppose an individual is tested every N days, and that for high-risk groups we test very frequently, so that  N<d. We assume that the time of the infection is random and an infected individual remains infective on the day of the test, and is only isolated from the following day onwards, since this is more likely than instant isolation. (We also consider the case of instant isolation in Appendix 1 and Figure 3.) Then, From this we can deduce that Here we introduce our self-isolation factor α into equation (3) by noting that rj during the infectious and asymptomatic period (first 5 days), which we denote as d0=5, is still r0 =R0/d    and thereafter rα =(1−α)R0/d for the infectious period in which a person may self-isolate. Substituting these values into rj we have three alternative situations to consider: (i) the case when N<d0 for which the testing rate is more frequent than the move to becoming symptomatic that occurs after day d0 and therefore equation (3) represents this outcome entirely; (ii) the case when d0 < N < d for which the testing period N is between 6 and 13 days inclusive, and finally (iii) the case when N ≥ d. The following is for the case when d0 < N < d which is the testing range that tends to deliver an R’ < 1 for this model of testing: We take rα=(1−α)R0/d to be the daily likelihood that an infected individual will infect another person during the period in which they may become symptomatic and self-isolate with probability α. This gives14 We now use equation (5) to solve for the value of N, the number of days between each periodic test that is required to bring R down from R0=2.5 to R’= 0.75. We find that the required periodic testing rate is 17 per cent of the population (or a test every 6 days), when isolation happens the day after a positive test. This assumes a test has a 30 per cent false negative rate. If these tests were perfect, then the required test rate could be 12 per cent of the population per day (or once every 8.2 days). If we instead use instant tests with 30 per cent false negatives (see Appendix 1 and Figure 3), the required testing rate is 13.4 per cent (or every 7.7 days). It is interesting to note that the effect on testing rates is similar for having an unreliable test (30 per cent false negatives versus no false negatives), and having to wait a day for results. In section V we show that these testing rates required to get R’=0.75 are around 37 per cent lower than those required under universal random testing. \\nFigure 1 plots R’ as a function of t, the proportion of the population tested each day. It does this for various values of α, the proportion of infected people who display symptoms and self-isolate from day 6 onwards. Higher levels of α mean that the effective reproduction rate, R’, is lower for a given level of testing; this effect is particularly marked at lower levels of the daily population testing rate. As we have already seen, when α = 0.5 the testing rate t needs to be about 17 per cent to get R’ down to 0.75. Figure 1 also displays the different testing rates needed to obtain a range of different values for R’, for a variety of values of α. This enables us to identify the threshold testing rates, t* that reduce R’ to exactly 1: the value which divides outcomes in which the epidemic dies out from outcomes in which it explodes. For α = 0.5, this threshold testing rate implied to bring R’ to 1 is t* = 11 per cent, i.e. 11 per cent of the population would need to be tested each day. To achieve this, everyone would need to be tested every 9 days. \\nFigure 1 also shows us how sensitive this threshold testing rate is to α, the proportion of those who are infected who self-isolate from day 6 onwards. For testing rates that are below 20 per cent per day (i.e. less frequent than once every 5 days, the period for which a person is assumed to be asymptomatic), we can clearly see how sensitive this threshold testing rate is to α. This is an important figure since α may change from population group to population group. For example, contract workers who are paid by the hour have a direct incentive to ignore symptoms. This would translate to a lower α for this group and consequently a much higher R’ for any rate of testing. Workers in this category who also have high contact rates as part of their job would therefore be expected to require the highest rate of testing. The epidemic would be most easy to control if all infected individuals become symptomatic after 5 days, and then all self-isolated. (This would mean that α = 1.00.) In such a case, as we can see, R’ ≈ 1 even without any testing. But in this case it would still be necessary to test all of those in a group every 12 days, in order to bring R’ down to 0.75. If scarce testing is to be allocated over individuals with different prior probabilities of infection, these formulas can be used to optimize the allocation. If we take the simplest form of our periodic testing model, when α = 0, for high frequency testing where an individual has a test after a smaller number of days than the length of an infection (N<d), then equation (3) simplifies to: Suppose that individual k has prior probability pk  of infection and that we wish to choose Nk so as to allocate a given amount of testing over a set of individuals so as to maximally reduce R’. Then, using frequent testing where an individual has a test after a smaller number of days than the length of an infection (N<d), the optimal allocation of a given amount of testing should choose Nk ∝ 1/ pk. This shows very clearly that there are diminishing returns to making N very small—that is conducting more frequent tests results in diminishing reductions in R’. The amount of testing allocated, therefore, to higher-risk individuals is naturally higher, but not proportionately so. Periodic testing periods of around 6 days may be sufficient to control the propagation of infection on their own. This is testing approximately 17 per cent of the population each day. This figure is highly sensitive to changes in self-isolation behaviour and the characteristics of the test being administered. Our model moves us towards a useful framework for determining the frequency with which a subgroup need be tested. For any particular subgroup, the frequency of testing which is required to reduce transmission sufficiently is determined by the both the subgroup’s properties and the properties of the test. A group’s key factors are the capability of its individuals to self-isolate if symptomatic, and the initial propagation rate  R0. The important figures for the test are the speed of results and the accuracy with which it reports positive results. Our model shows the way in which all of these factors can be traded off against one another. We assume that the whole population is randomly tested. We let t be the proportion of the population tested each day and then isolated if they are infected. As in section IV we assume patients are infectious for d =14 days, symptomatic cases show symptoms and self-isolate after d0 = 5 days, but that only half are themselves symptomatic, i.e. α = 0.5. Of these tests we assume that 30 per cent return false negative results, i.e. that n = 0.3. We also assume ‘instant isolation’, where an infectious person is isolated immediately on the day that they receive a positive test result, and so are not able to infect others, even on that day. In practice this would mean an early morning test with rapid results. This is different from our assumption in section IV, where we assumed ‘delayed isolation’ so that patients remain able to infect others on the day of their test, and only begin to isolate on the next day. We think delayed isolation is a more plausible assumption. But we assume instant isolation in this section so as to make our results more nearly comparable with those of Romer (2020a,b). Nevertheless we extend our analysis to consider the case of universal random testing with delayed isolation in section V(iv). Our calculations proceed as follows. We consider the impact of an infectious person on others when he or she has a probability t of being tested each day, and so of being placed in isolation immediately if the test is positive. For clarity, it is helpful to think about the ‘discovery rate’ x, where x = t(1 – n) and n is the number of tests which show false negatives, which we take to be n = 0.3. The variable x shows the probability that, on any day on which this person is infectious, he or she is isolated. This means that (1 – x) is the probability that this person will not be isolated, and so be able to infect people on that day and subsequent days. If there were no self-isolation of those who became symptomatic, then the probability of an infectious person remaining undetected on day j is (1 – x)j and the expected number of infections caused by an infected person on day j is rj. Therefore, in expectation, an infected person would infect r1(1−x) persons on day 1 of their infection,    r2(1− x)2 persons on day 2, and so on, up to    r14(1− x)14 persons on the final day d. We assume that the infection rate is constant over the infected period and so rj=R0/d. We allow for self-isolation by letting the proportion who are symptomatic, α, self-isolate after 5 days. So, only a proportion (1 – α) go on being tested from day 6 onwards. We can thus write our key equation as follows: or, in more compact notation: Our ambition is to get to a position where each infectious person only infects 0.75 other people on average, so that the virus dies out. We seek to find the value of x which would achieve this. Recalling that R0 = 2.5, and letting d = 14, we then can solve for x in equation (8): or, in more concise notation, The solution to this equation can be obtained numerically16 for various values of α. When α = 0.5, as roughly observed in Iceland, x ≈ 0.146. But t = x/(1 – n). And n, the proportion of false negatives, is equal to 0.3. So the required probability of testing on each day, t, is given by t = 0.146/0.7 ≈ 0.209. That is to say, the proportion of people tested on any day must be as high as 21 per cent in order to achieve the required 14.6 per cent discovery rate x. Recall from equation (1) that R’ = (1 – φ)R0, where φ is the proportion of the infectious population which is isolated. With R0 = 2.5 and R’ = 0.75, this means that φ = 0.7. Thus, over the 14 days in which a person is infectious, this person will, on average, be in isolation for 70 per cent of the time. We have shown that to achieve such a very striking outcome, the probability of testing an infected person who is not yet isolated on any day must be at least 21 per cent. With random, population-wide testing, this means, in effect, that everybody in the population has to be tested about every 5 days. The dotted line in Figure 2 plots R’ as a function of the proportion of the population tested, under Universal Random Testing. As we have already seen, when half of those who are infected self-isolate from day 6 onwards, i.e. α = 0.5, t needs to be equal to about 21 per cent to get R’ down to 0.75. More than this, the figure also displays the different testing rates which are required to obtain a range of different values for R’. And it does this for different values of α as well. \\nFigure 2 enables us to identify the threshold testing rates, t* that reduce R’ to exactly 1, and so just stop the epidemic from exploding.17For α = 0.5, this threshold testing rate is t* = 13 per cent. To achieve this, everyone would need to be tested, on average, every 8 days. This is still way above Romer’s proposed testing rate of 7 per cent. Figure 2 also displays the sensitivity of the results to various values of α, the proportion of infected people who display symptoms and self-isolate. It shows that, at one extreme, when all cases are symptomatic after 5 days and then self-isolate (i.e. when α = 1.00), the situation seems just about manageable: the epidemic would stop exploding even without any testing. Nevertheless, the required value of t which would ensure that R’ = 0.75, is about 8.2 per cent. This percentage is actually a little above that proposed by Romer because infected asymptomatic people do a lot of damage in the first 5 days! At the other extreme, with α = 0.00, the situation is much worse: the probability of testing per day, t*, which is required to stop the epidemic exploding is now nearly 20 per cent (19.1 per cent) and the value of t required to ensure that R’ = 0.75 is about 26 per cent (26.1 per cent). Data for the extent to which infectious people become symptomatic is currently extremely unreliable and furthermore the range of possibilities seems very wide. Even if over half of infected people self-isolate, around 20 per cent of the population would need to be tested every day to get R’ to 0.75. The outcomes depicted in Figure 2 suggest that, on the balance of probabilities, universal random testing would be unworkable. Returning to the share of asymptomatic cases observed in Iceland (i.e. the case when α = 0.5), Figure 2 shows that by setting a testing rate of 7 per cent of the population, as advocated by Romer (2020b), the epidemic actually remains explosive with R’ equal to about 1.3. In this situation, infection would spread rapidly in the earlier stages, since the testing rate is not high enough to control and eliminate the disease; all testing would do is slow down the inevitable spread of the disease. It is clear that the speed at which the disease spreads depends not only on R’, but also on the number of days, d, for which infected individuals remain infectious, and on whether infectiousness is spread evenly over the time of infection—as assumed here—or is instead concentrated in the early days of infection. Obviously as the disease spreads, the number of people susceptible to infection begins to fall, and then to fall rapidly. Ultimately, the fact that more and more people have had the disease and so are immune will bring the spread to an end and the proportion of those who have been infected will tend towards a constant level which has become known as the ‘herd immunity’ proportion. It can be shown, for any R, that this proportion is given by (1 – 1/R).18 Without testing, and a value of R0 of 2.5, the herd immunity proportion is as high as 60 per cent. Universal random testing (as advocated by Romer (2020a,b)) of 7 per cent of the population per day would reduce R’ to 1.3, and so reduce the herd immunity proportion, to which the population is tending in the long run, to about 23 per cent. But in the earlier stages of infection, when there is almost no immunity, the disease would still spread rapidly as the testing rate would not be high enough to slow the spread in a controlled manner, particularly if each person infected other people quickly. Thus, in sum, we can say that universal random testing at this rate would only slow the spread (or ‘flatten the curve’), but would not control the initial explosive phase of the epidemic. It would not stop very large numbers of people being infected. This is therefore a risky strategy. Peak levels of infection might rise beyond the capacity of the health system to deal with the epidemic. Even if testing rates were then increased, lags in responses would mean that the spread of infection would only be gradually reduced. Meanwhile, the virus would go on spreading towards the herd immunity level. Of course, there are many changes to our assumptions which could modify our calculations. In particular, there would be significant reductions in required testing rates if whole households were to be self-isolated in the event that anyone in the household tested positive. If, for example, only one person in a household were tested at any time, and households consisted on average of two people, then each positive test would remove two people into isolation. That is, testing would become more effective. On the other hand, our calculations have deliberately assumed that anyone testing positive immediately isolates themselves, and so is not infectious on the day of the test. Using the more cautious assumption that those testing positive are only isolated on the following day, and so only stop infecting other people then, equation (8a) now becomes: or, in more concise notation: The results found using this equation are much worse than those described in section V(i). With α = 0.5, the critical testing rate, t*, is now 16 per cent, and the testing rate required to get R’ down to 0.75 is now as high as 27 per cent. A bit over a quarter of the population would need to be tested every day! We can now compare the benefits of stratified periodic testing with those of universal random testing. In section IV and Figure 1 we showed that under stratified periodic testing with half of cases being asymptomatic, a 30 per cent false negative rate, and isolation the day after a positive test, the testing rate needed to bring R down from R0 =2.5 to R’=0.75 would be 17 per cent of the population each day (or testing each person every 6 days). In section V(iv) we showed that under universal random testing, using the same assumptions, the required testing rate would be 27 per cent, or testing each person about every 4 days. This is a 37 per cent reduction in the number of people needing to be tested each day—the same impact on D’ for a significantly reduced cost. The advantages of stratified periodic testing are robust to other assumptions. If we assume that people immediately self-isolate after testing positive, and so are not infectious on the day of their test, then we would only need to test 13.4 per cent of the population per day to achieve R’=0.75 (as shown in Appendix 1 and Figure 3), versus 21 per cent of the population per day under universal random testing (as shown in section V(i) and Figure 2). If, instead, we assume that the tests return zero false negatives (n=0), but people are infectious on the day of their test, then we must test 12 per cent of the population each day under stratified periodic testing to achieve R’=0.75, versus 19 per cent under universal random testing. We conclude that for the universal random testing proposed to be workable (which would require testing, say, less than 10 per cent of the population per day) policy-makers would require confidence that: Unfortunately, we do not feel that all these conditions can be met given our current state of knowledge about the virus. So, we do not believe that whole-population random testing would be a good use of resources. Instead, stratified periodic testing is both workable, and an efficient use of finite testing resources. This paper proposes ‘stratified periodic testing’ as a strategy for ensuring that R’ < 1 and so preventing an explosive re-emergence of COVID-19. Such a strategy is necessary for lockdown to be ended and for economies to return to work. The testing would be ‘stratified’, in the sense that it would focus on specific subsets of the population who currently have the highest reproduction number R. The criteria for choosing who would be tested could be amended to also take into account the vulnerability of subgroups, or the loss of economic activity if they are forced to self-isolate at home. This ensures that infected people can be identified and isolated quickly. The testing would be ‘periodic’, in the sense that each member of the subset would be tested at regular, defined intervals, rather than testing within the group being done at random. Those who test positive would be quickly isolated at home, as would anyone with symptoms. The tests need not be perfect: if they are cheap but deployed widely within particular groups, then false negatives can be offset by increasing the frequency of testing. The effectiveness of the programme can be improved by simple tracing of the contacts of those infected: for example testing those in their workplaces and households, rather than fully tracking mobile-phone movements with the associated privacy concerns. It would also be improved by ensuring that all members of a household are isolated if any member tests positive. We argue that this is better than ‘universal random testing’ which is currently being discussed in many places. Romer (2020a,b) suggests that by testing 7 per cent of the population every day we can get the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 to around 0.75 and thereby curb the epidemic. Unfortunately, Romer’s calculations contain errors. By correcting his method, and using reasonable assumptions about asymptomatic carriers, we believe that, if this strategy were followed, at least 21 per cent of the population would need to be tested each day to get the effective reproduction number down to well below 1 (e.g. to a value of 0.75). For obvious reasons, we do not see this as a feasible population-wide strategy. Any testing strategy should be thought of as a complement to other measures that can reduce the spread of COVID-19 at little economic cost. For example, those who can work from home with little loss of productivity should continue to do so, retirees should continue to self-isolate, and people in public places should wear masks and regularly wash their hands. A process of stratified periodic testing might well become part of a strategy of ensuring that workers can get back to work quickly and safely in sectors of the economy in which work cannot be performed at home. This process should continue until widespread vaccines or treatment for the virus are available.'}},\n",

       "   'abstract-full': \"An important component of every country's COVID-19 response is fast and efficient testing -- to identify and isolate cases, as well as for early detection of local hotspots. For many countries, producing a sufficient number of tests has been a serious limiting factor in their efforts to control COVID-19 infections. Group testing is a well-established mathematical tool, which can provide a serious and rapid improvement to this situation. In this note, we compare several well-established group testing schemes in the context of qPCR testing for COVID-19. We include example calculations, where we indicate which testing architectures yield the greatest efficiency gains in various settings. We find that for identification of individuals with COVID-19, array testing is usually the best choice, while for estimation of COVID-19 prevalence rates in the total population, Gibbs-Gower testing usually provides the most accurate estimates given a fixed and relatively small number of tests. This note is intended as a helpful handbook for labs implementing group testing methods.\",\n",

The mainstay of diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 is molecular polymerase chain reaction testing of a respiratory specimen, obtained with a viral swab. As the incidence of new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 increases exponentially, the use of viral swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimens is anticipated to increase drastically. CASE REPORT: This paper draws attention to a complication of viral swab testing in the nasopharynx and describes the premature engagement of a viral swab breakpoint, resulting in impaction in the nasal cavity. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a possible design flaw of the viral swab when used to collect nasopharyngeal specimens, which then requires an aerosol-generating procedure in a high-risk patient to be performed. The paper outlines a safe technique of nasal foreign body removal in a suspected coronavirus disease 2019 patient and suggests alternative testing materials.',\n",

       "   'abstract-full': 'BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019, a highly transmissible respiratory infection, has created a public health crisis of global magnitude. The mainstay of diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 is molecular polymerase chain reaction testing of a respiratory specimen, obtained with a viral swab. As the incidence of new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 increases exponentially, the use of viral swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimens is anticipated to increase drastically. CASE REPORT: This paper draws attention to a complication of viral swab testing in the nasopharynx and describes the premature engagement of a viral swab breakpoint, resulting in impaction in the nasal cavity. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a possible design flaw of the viral swab when used to collect nasopharyngeal specimens, which then requires an aerosol-generating procedure in a high-risk patient to be performed. The paper outlines a safe technique of nasal foreign body removal in a suspected coronavirus disease 2019 patient and suggests alternative testing materials.',\n",
       "   'body_text-full': \"Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a respiratory infection in humans that was first identified as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan city, China, in December 2019.1,2 The offending pathogen is a novel coronavirus, isolated on 7th January 2020, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).2 The clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic, to a mild upper respiratory infection, to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory failure and death.2 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Covid-19 pandemic on 11th March 2020.3 Diagnostic testing plays a crucial role in outbreak initial detection, containment, effective isolation and eventual resolution.4 A male nursing home resident in his late seventies presented to the emergency department after an unwitnessed fall, unable to mobilise. He had a background of severe dementia and chronic kidney disease. He was diagnosed with a right-sided neck of femur fracture. He was admitted and underwent an uncomplicated right-sided hemi-arthroplasty. Three days post-operatively, he developed a low grade fever. He was suspected of having Covid-19 as he had been in contact with other patients on the ward who had subsequently tested positive for the virus. The patient lacked capacity and was uncooperative whilst undergoing a nasopharyngeal swab test for Covid-19. Despite gentle restraint from a trained healthcare assistant, rapid head movements resulted in the engagement of the swab breakpoint mechanism, whilst the swab was still in the nasal cavity. The swab was retained in the nose out of direct vision. The ENT registrar was called to retrieve the swab. The patient underwent a bedside examination with a flexible nasendoscope. A nasal swab stick was found in the right nasal cavity, under the inferior turbinate on the floor, midway in the nasal cavity (Figure 1). Retrieval of an 8 cm swab was performed with minimal trauma under direct vision using Tilley's dressing forceps.\\n The swab tested positive for Covid-19 and the patient was transferred to a ring-fenced Covid-19 ward. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has an affinity for respiratory epithelium. Zou et al. compared throat and nasal swabs, and found higher viral loads in the nose compared to the throat.5 Liu et al. found that patients with severe Covid-19 harboured a greater viral load and a longer virus-shedding period in the nasopharynx compared to mild cases.6 The primary means of diagnosing Covid-19 at present is via molecular testing to detect viral RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.7 Clinical suspicion and several laboratory findings may raise the probability of Covid-19, including decreased albumin, raised C-reactive protein, high lactate dehydrogenase, lymphopenia, high aspartate transaminase and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate.8 Chest radiographs show bilateral changes, often ground-glass opacification.8 Computed tomography changes include multifocal bilateral or isolated round ground-glass opacity with or without patchy consolidations, prominent peripherally and in the posterior or lower lobe.9 The viral specimen swabs used in our unit are Sigma Virocult®.10 They consist of two components, a plastic swab, which incorporates a breakpoint halfway down the shaft of the swab, and a Sigma Swab® tip (an open-celled foam bud) to capture the specimen (Figure 2). This specially designed tip is reported to provide optimum uptake and release of micro-organisms, and allow flow of the sample through the reagents used in the testing process, in comparison to a standard swab that uses either a cotton or rayon spun fibre tip.\\n The swab is then inserted into a plastic tube containing a viral transport medium (Figure 2). The manufacturer reports that this medium aids the survival of many types of common viruses, either at room temperature or refrigerated, stabilising the viral particles and utilising antimicrobial agents to prevent the growth of either bacteria or fungi that may also be present on the swab.10 The ENT-specific swab types are produced by Sigma for application in the nasopharynx.10 They utilise a finer tip and narrower shaft at the tip end of the swab. These swabs also incorporate a breakpoint feature.10 The breakpoint mechanism prevents contamination whilst transferring the shaft into the bottle; however, this feature makes the swab susceptible to fracture whilst still in the nasal cavity, as illustrated in our case. This situation could arise in non-cooperative patients, such as those with advanced dementia or severe learning difficulties, and in patients with anatomical variations (e.g. septal deviations and spurs). Head or limb movements can easily lead to the swab breaking and the swab tip being lost in the nasal cavity. If this does occur, further aerosol-generating procedures, such as flexible nasendoscopy and manual retrieval with surgical instruments, may be required in an already challenging patient. Foreign body removal from the nose is an aerosol-generating procedure and therefore warrants robust personal protective equipment, in line with ENT UK and NHS England guidance.11,12 Covid-19 precautions also include the examination and therapeutic intervention being delivered in a ‘one-stop’ episode, limiting the location, frequency and personnel to a single episode, to reduce the risk to the patient, nearby patients and healthcare staff.11 In order to optimise the success and retrieval of a nasal foreign body in a Covid-19 patient, and reduce the risk of aerosol generation, we recommend the application of a pledget soaked in vasoconstrictor and local anaesthetic solution to the nasal cavity, to reduce mucosal oedema and desensitise nasal mucosa prior to anterior rhinoscopy. Intranasal spray should be avoided, as this may induce aerosolisation.13 Initially, anterior rhinoscopy may be carried out with a Thudicum nasal speculum, to accentuate the internal nasal valve area, the narrowest cross-sectional area of the nose. Foreign bodies deep to the internal valve require examination with a rigid or flexible nasendoscope. Close face-to-face proximity should be avoided where possible, and therefore nasal endoscopy should be carried out with a video display as per ENT UK guidance.13 Although the rigid scope is preferable, as it enables a single operator to handle both the scope and surgical instruments, it should be avoided in an uncooperative patient. A flexible nasendoscope requires two hands to operate and therefore an assistant is required for foreign body removal (Figure 3).\\n We opted to use a flexible nasendoscope with an assistant. Although this increased personnel exposure, we aimed to remove the swab at the patient's bedside in one single episode, to avoid the patient undergoing a general anaesthetic. Instrumentation to remove the foreign body is dictated by the item in question, and in this situation, we used Tilley's nasal dressing forceps to retrieve the nasal swab (Figure 3). A retained foreign body post-procedure is a ‘never event’,14 and must be prevented at all costs. In a patient with a potential Covid-19 infection, a retained nasal swab not only poses a risk to the patient but also to healthcare staff, and the ensuing aerosol-generating procedures required to remove it further increase the risk of disease transmission to healthcare staff. The simplest way to avoid this complication is to utilise a product without a breakpoint. Based on the information from WHO15 and other sources,16,17 there are several alternative products for viral sampling that are readily available on the market, or already in use in the clinical environment, that do not have the breakpoint feature. The use of alternative swabs, either dry or transported with a small amount of sterile saline, may provide a useful alternative in patients at risk of experiencing premature breaking of the viral swab shaft in the nasal cavity. This is supported by the WHO guidance, which suggests that nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab products with Dacron® or polyester flocked swabs can be used, and if viral transport medium is unavailable, then sterile saline may be used in replacement.15 It must be noted that when there is likely to be a delay in specimens reaching the laboratory, the use of viral transport medium is strongly recommended by WHO.15 Druce et al. demonstrated that dry swabs, transported in either saline or dry, had similar efficacy in detecting various viruses as purpose-specific viral swabs that were sent in either universal transport medium or specific viral transport medium.16 Moore et al. revealed that the use of dry swabs with no transport medium was not only a suitable alternative, but it also produced a higher detection rate of respiratory viruses by using real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, compared to more traditional methods of detection.17\\n\\n•Viral swab sticks generally have a breakpoint feature•Premature activation of the breakpoint in a complex group of patients can lead to a retained swab tip in the nasal cavity•Nasal foreign body removal is an aerosol-generating procedure and requires robust personal protective equipment•The simplest way to avoid this complication is to utilise a product without a breakpoint•Alternative swab products with Dacron or polyester flocked tips can be used, and if viral transport medium is unavailable, then sterile saline may be used in replacement We suggest that hospitals liaise with their local microbiology laboratory and seek alternative arrangements for swab testing if concerned about premature breakage in vulnerable patients. We have described a novel adverse event encountered with a Covid-19 viral swab. The patient was subjected to an aerosol-generating procedure to remove the nasal swab from the nasal cavity. The viral swab has an intrinsic design feature that gives rise to this complication. We have outlined appropriate techniques to address this complication and suggested a solution to circumvent this problem, which may be useful in a complex subset of suspected Covid-19 patients.\",\n",

       "   'abstract-full': 'OBJECTIVES To identify whether the scratch test can be used as an alternative to the Weber\\'s test after tympanomastoid surgery. METHODS This twin-center prospective study assessed major tympanomastoid surgery patients over a 6-month period. Patients were assessed postoperatively on Day 0 or Day 1 of surgery using a standardized proforma. A Weber\\'s test was performed using a 512-Hz tuning fork, placed midline on the forehead to assess the direction of sound localization. This was directly compared with a scratch test, by asking the patient the following while scratching the head bandage in the midline: \"Can you hear this? And which side is loudest?\" RESULTS Fifty-six patients were assessed in total. Sixteen mastoid explorations, 14 tympanoplasties, 18 combined approach tympanoplasties, and 8 other procedures were included, all of which had standard external auditory canal packing and head bandage. Assessment with Weber\\'s test found 41 patients to have sound lateralizing to the operated ear. In comparison, 50 patients lateralized sound to the operated ear with the scratch test. Overall, Weber\\'s test had a sensitivity of 73.2% and specificity of 100% compared with a sensitivity of 89.3% and specificity of 100% for the \"Scratch Test.\" No patients had a dead ear after surgery. CONCLUSION The scratch test proved to be more accurate than traditional postoperative tuning fork assessment and provides a quick, accurate, and simple solution for when such equipment is unavailable.',\n",

When the goal is screening for infectious disease, one approach is group testing in which samples are initially tested in pools and individual samples are retested only if the initial pooled test was positive. Intuitively, if the prevalence of infection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number of tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies has been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the accuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing the issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume that the misclassification parameters are known from an external population and/or that the values do not change with the group size. Both of these assumptions are highly questionable for many medical practitioners considering group testing in their study design. In this article, we explore how the failure of these assumptions might impact the efficacy of a group testing design and, consequently, whether group testing is currently feasible for medical screening. Specifically, we look at how incorrect assumptions about the sensitivity function at the design stage can lead to poor estimation of a procedure's overall sensitivity and expected number of tests. Furthermore, if a validation study is used to estimate the pooled misclassification parameters of a given assay, we show that the sample sizes required are so large as to be prohibitive in all but the largest screening programs\"}},\n",

However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck, especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore, requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.'}},\n",

In this paper, we consider a noisy variant of group testing where test results are flipped with certain probability, including the realistic scenario where sensitivity and specificity can take arbitrary values.
