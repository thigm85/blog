On the other hand, a query triggers a search action, and we can only process it in real-time. Search apps’ goal is to return the most relevant documents to the query as quickly as possible. By applying the tokenizer to the documents as soon as we feed them to the application, we only need to tokenize the query when a search action is required, saving us precious time."

    "We showed how to customize BERT model encodings to ensure this training and serving compatibility. However, a better approach is to build tools that bridge the gap between training and serving by allowing users to request training data that respects by default the encodings used when serving the model. [pyvespa](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) will include such integration to make it easier for [Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) users to train BERT models without having to adjust the encoding generation manually as we did above."
